The Hubble Space Telescope is a remarkable scientific instrument that has been orbiting Earth since 1990. It was launched by NASA and ESA as a joint project to observe the universe in unprecedented detail and clarity. The telescope can capture images in different wavelengths of light, from ultraviolet to near-infrared, revealing phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye. The telescope has made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as the expansion rate and age of the universe, the existence of black holes, the formation of planets, and the diversity of galaxies. The telescope is also a source of inspiration and wonder for the public, as it shares its stunning images and videos of cosmic beauty. The Hubble Space Telescope is a testament to human curiosity and ingenuity, and a legacy for future generations of astronomers.
